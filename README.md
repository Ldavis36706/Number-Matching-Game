# Number-Matching-Game
I created this game to encourage my daughter to learn through play. She is beginning to learn and recognize her numbers. The matching game helps toddlers differentiate one object from another. It helps with increasing short term memory and attention to detail. There are several other benefits such as: improves focus, concentration, attention, and critical thinking. I will eventually add some sounds and graphics to make it more interactive.

Below you can see images of the game:

When you select a matching pair the numbers will have a green outline to let you know you were successful:
